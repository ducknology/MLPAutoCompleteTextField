This is a personal fork of Eddy's MLPAutoCompleteTextField. For primary information please refer to 
https://github.com/EddyBorja/MLPAutoCompleteTextField

This fork added a function in delegate to set which view to attach the auto-complete-table, and removed the behavior that the table will be insert below the textfield.
